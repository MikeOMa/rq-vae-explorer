Execute the implementation plan in docs/plans/2026-01-21-rq-vae-explorer-implementation.md task by task, following TDD.

For each task:
1. Write the failing test first
2. Run the test to confirm it fails
3. Write the implementation
4. Run the test to confirm it passes
5. Commit

Work through all 14 tasks sequentially. Signal LOOP_COMPLETE when finished.
